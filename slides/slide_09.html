    <p class="fragment">The script defines a global variable/object, that is the map and all its functions

    <p class="fragment">There are two ways to load a script, synchronously and asynchronously:</p>
    <p class="notes fragment"><strong>asynchronously</strong> means that your page will continue doing what a page has to do, while the script is being loaded</p>
    <p class="notes fragment"><strong>synchronously</strong> means that your page will stop everything and wait for the script to be loaded in order to continue</p>
