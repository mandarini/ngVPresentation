**Slides created with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)**

These are my slides for the ngVikings conference presentation!

Finally added the [polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/#html-imports-polyfill) for 
 [HTML Imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/HTML_Imports),
so now all browsers are supported!
