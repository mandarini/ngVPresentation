**Slides created with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)**

These are my slides for the ngVikings conference presentation!

They will not work on Firefox because I am using [HTML Imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/HTML_Imports),
which Firefox does not ship.
